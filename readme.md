"Things We Do" App by iamnotagoodartist
=======================================

A visualized, folksonomyâ€™d work task inventory experiment. Not much to it, but probably better seen than explained. Just click on things and use your arrow keys.

### Requirements and Instructions

Needs PHP and MySQL.

1. Upload everything to your server
2. Make a new database called "thingswedo"
3. Modify row 6 of index.php with your database host, user, and password
4. Modify row 26 with an actual username and password (You make this part up)
4. Run it (it will create a table)
5. Do what it says and remove the line that just created that table 
6. Modify rows 203 - 206 of style.css to give specific tags their own colors (You can decide these as you go)

### Credit

Uses these jQuery plugins:

* [Masonry](http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry/)
* [autoResize](http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/)
* [Tag Suggestions](http://remysharp.com/2007/12/28/jquery-tag-suggestion/)

### Notes

Install in a root if you don't want to change all the location redirects and form actions. I'll leave it up to you to figure it out if you decide otherwise. And, yeah, I know the single username/password security isn't very substantial. Beef it up if you care to.
